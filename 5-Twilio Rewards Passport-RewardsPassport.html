o	Complete your profile fully (current address, realistic desired home price).
o	Follow up if matched lenders don't respond — you might need to request human review if the automated match wasn't ideal.
o	Check your Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion credit reports ahead of time.
o	Fill out all lead generation forms carefully (e.g., accurate income, intent to buy timeline).

Yo.ai helps you manage financial incentive programs by calculating the return on your investment,
which could be buying an item at full price to receive an additional item at no charge,
or merely 'entering your information' like filling out a credit card application to get double the miles on a frequent flier program.            
</p>

<p>
You benefit directly when the automated decisions organizations make result in a net gain for you;<br/> 
You may also benefit directly when organizations violate consumer protections.
